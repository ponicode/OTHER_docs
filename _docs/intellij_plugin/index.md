# The Ponicode IntelliJ Plugin


Ponicode IntelliJ IDEA extension is an IDE extension which allows to generate Unit Tests for your Java code in seconds.

Follow the [Get Started guide](/docs/intellij_plugin/setup) to learn how to install and activate the extension.

Whenever Ponicode identifies a function in your code which it is able to test, it displays a little Pony icon to its left. On each of these functions, [you can use Ponicode to generate your unit tests for you](/docs/intellij_plugin/use)!

You may want to see what Ponicode supports by jumping to the [supported technologies page](/docs/intellij_plugin/supported)
