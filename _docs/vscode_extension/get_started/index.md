# Get Started

In this section you will find all the basic information you need to get started.

First of all, learn how to [install and activate](/docs/vscode_extension/get_started/installation) the Ponicode extension, and how to [enable it or disable it](/docs/vscode_extension/get_started/startStopPonicode) as you need.

Then skip through to learn how to create your first AI-powered unit test, both with our one-click [Flash test](/docs/vscode_extension/flash_test/index/) solution, and [using the Ponicode Interface](/docs/vscode_extension/gui_test/firstUtGUI).
