# Ponicode DogString

Ponicode DogString generate docstring for all your Python functions in a matter of seconds.

The docstrings generated by Ponicode follow the Google docstring convention: they inlcude a one-line description of what a function does, and a list of the function arguments. Each argument is followed by its type (infered by Ponicode), but the description of each argument should be completed by you.

Here is an example:
